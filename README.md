# Multi-Seasonal-Time-decompostion-and-Predection-of-Intraday-trading-Volume


When transaction prices are uncertain and markets are not easy flowing,
the act of trading then will require analysis. This paper studies the statistical technique used to
decompose a times series of price and trading volume already established on the market. In
doing so, we study order flow as an endogenous part of the system. We show how, given an
underlying demand curve, the trader will choose an optimal (price, quantity) order to
transmit to the market. Consider water demand as an example. Water demand has daily
seasonality (more demand during the day than late at night), weekly seasonality (weekends
vs weekdays), and yearly seasonality (demand in the summer and winter differs due to
heating and cooling needs). Well, forecasting a time series can be challenging sometimes,
but if we can break the series down into its individual parts and analyze each one
independently, we can occasionally improve overall prediction. With this way, we may
employ techniques that are better suited to each distinct component because each has
unique qualities and behaviors. Decomposition can be helpful when trying a predictive
analysis, but it is important to keep in mind that it is primarily used to analyze and
comprehend historical time series.
